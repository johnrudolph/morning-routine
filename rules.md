# Components

## Rooms
Each room is an envelope. There are also 8 hallways envelopes. You will always have 1 room envelope in your hand, which indicates where you are.

## Reward cards
Each room has reward cards. Players collect these as they complete activities in the room. All reward cards have a point value, which will count toward your final score. Most reward cards have a special effect that will help you outsmart your opponents. These cards will tell you when they can be revealed. Once one of those cards has been revealed, it cannot be used again, but will still count toward your points at the end.

## Speed bonus cards
These cards reward you for finishing your morning routine faster. 

## Queue cards
Each player has a set of these. When you are waiting in the Hallway, you can leave one of these facedown to indicate that you are waiting in line for that room. Importantly, this is also how you bust other players for leaving a mess.

## Mess cards
Every activity you do will leave a mess behind. Mess cards have different point values, so you'll have to choose how much of a mess you leave in each room.

# Setup
1. Place the room envelopes in the center of the table, face down.
2. Place the speed bonus cards in a face-up deck in descending order, so that the highest point value card is on top.
3. Each player selects a collects a set of 4 mess cards with point values of -3, -2, -1, and +1.
4. Determine a fist player. Whichever two players will go last start the game with a random room envelope.

# Gameplay
Determine a first player. 

## Player turn
On your turn, you will do one of the following:

### From the hallway
At the beginning of the game, you have no room envelope, which means you are in the hallway. After you leave any room, you will return to the Hallway. Here are the actions you can take from the Hallway. When it is your turn in the Hallway, you may always: 

- Look at the facedown room envelopes in the room deck
- Place / Change one of your queue cards facedown in front of you to indicate which room you are waiting to enter. 

If your turn starts and you are in the Hallway, you can look at all of the facedown room envelopes. Then you can do one of the following:

#### Enter a room
Select an envelope to keep, and leave the rest facedown. 

#### Go to school
If you are satisfied with how many points you have, you can leave from the Hallway and end your game. Take the next available Speed Bonus card and place it in front of you to indicate that you are done and will not take any more turns.

### From a room
If you have a room envelope in your posession, do one of the following:

#### Collect a reward card
As you do this, show the backs of the cards to other players to clearly demonstrate what you're doing.
1. Take a mess card from your hand, and place it in the room envelope.
2. Take a reward card from the room envelope, and add it to your hand.

You cannot take a reward card if you do not have a mess card to replace it with.

#### Clean
Remove any mess cards from your room envelope you choose, and place them face-up in the mess discard pile. If you want to keep any of the mess cards face-up in front of you, you can.

#### Return to the Hallway
1. Announce that you are returning to the Hallway.
2. If any player is queued to enter a room, they may reveal their queue card to you. You must show them which envelope you have.
  - If their queue card matches your envelope, you must give them the envelope. They have immediately entered the room you left. They can now open the envelope, and reveal all mess cards in the room. You must inherit any mess cards they discovered in the room. Leave these faceup in front of you as  for the rest of the game. These mess cards will count toward your final score.
  - If their queue card did not match your envelope, return your envelope to the room envelope deck, they return their queue card facedown in front of them, and the game proceeds as usual. 

## End of the morning
Once all players have gone to school, players will take turns revealing any of their rewards that have not been revealed. Beginning with the player with the highest Speed Bonus card, and continuing in descending order, each player will do the following: 

1. Reveal your face-down reward cards one by one. If these cards have effects that take place "at the end of the game," resolve those effects. 
2. If you have multiple cards from the same room, you must discard down to 1. Some cards (like Oatmeal) will prompt you to have multiple cards from the same room. But otherwise, you can only have 1 card from each room.

### Scoring
1. Add the point value of all of your reward cards and speed bonus card.
2. Subtract the point value of all of the mess cards you have face-up in front of you.

The player with the most points wins.
