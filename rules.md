# Components

## Rooms
Each room is an envelope. There are also 8 hallways envelopes. You will always have 1 room envelope in your hand, which indicates where you are.

## Reward cards
Each room has reward cards. Players collect these as they complete activities in the room.

## Mess cards
Every activity you do will leave a mess behind. Mess cards have different values, so you'll have to choose how much of a mess you leave in each room.

# Setup
1. Give each player a hallways envelope. Set the rest of the hallways envelopes back in the box.
2. Place the room envelopes in the center of the table, face down.
3. Each player selects a collects a set of 4 mess cards with values of 0, 1, 2, and 3.

# Gameplay
Determine a first player. 

## Player turn
On your turn, you will do one of the following:

### Enter a room
Pick up the facedown room envelopes. Select an envelope to keep, and leave the rest facedown. (Note: you can keep a Hallway envelope if you want. This can be a good way to trick your opponents into thinking you're in a room when you're not.)

### Perform an activity
Do the following in a room, and show everyone the backs of the cards as your move them to demonstrate that you're doing this.
1. Take a mess card from your hand, and place it in the room envelope. This is the mess you leave behind.
2. Take a reward card from the room envelope, and add it to your hand.
3. If you already have a reward card of this type revealed, you must discard it.

### Leave a room
1. Announce that you are moving.
2. Any player may challenge you. To do this, they must be in the Hallway, and must reveal their Hallway envelope. Then, they say a room name.
  - If they named the room you're leaving, you must reveal your room envelope. Then open the envelope, and reveal all mess cards in the room. Leave these faceup in front of you as a penalty for the rest of the game. Leave the room envelope faceup in front of you to demonstrate that you will have to skip your next turn. 
  - If they named a different room, show them (not everyone) your room envelope. Then, continue on your way to selecting another room.

### Go to the car
You may only do this if you are in the hallway. 
1. Show everyone your Hallway card to prove you are in the hallway, and return it to the room card stack.
2. Show everyone that you have a reward card from each room, and leave them faceup in front of you to demonstrate that you are done with your morning routine.

## End of the morning
Once all players have completed their morning routine, the game is over. 

### Scoring
1. Add the point value of all of your rewards.
2. Subtract the point value of all of the mess cards you have face-up in front of you.

The player with the most points wins.
