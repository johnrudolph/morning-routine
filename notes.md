# Problems

### Problem
Muddiness around the cost of cleaning. Can you clean an entire mess with one turn?
- Critically, the cost of cleaning should probably be less than the cost of getting busted? Is that a true assumption?

### Solutions
    -

### Problem
When you change rooms, we want to make sure you go back to the hallway. Problem is that if you have to announce this and demonstrate that you went back to the hallway, it announces to everyone that you're not in a room, and there's substantially less mystery / intrigue. But if you don't announce it, then you can just go back and forth between rooms without going to the hallway, which is cheap and boring.

### Solutions
- Naive solution: You have to announce that you're leaving a room and show everyone your new hallway card.
- More mysterious: you just allow them to move between rooms without announcing it. There's a rule that you have to go back to the hallway, but it's un-enforceable.
- Clean solution: You are allowed to go room to room. No extra rules, easy. But you never force anyone into the hallway, and that sucks? Maybe another way of looking at this would be to make the hallway so enticing that people want to be there? What if hallway people could at any time look at the facedown envelopes?

### Problem
It seems like a perfectly viable strategy is to just never clean any rooms and blitz it. This sucks because it's just a dumb race to get the reward cards, and we lose the trapping / lying / sneaking / backstabbing / etc.
- once you see two players go into rooms, it just puts this crazy pressure on you to go into rooms.

### Solutions
- Don't punish players for challenging people. It costs enough to tell everyone where you are.

### Problem
It can feel samey. If we all have to go to all four rooms, it's repetitive and tedious.
- I have no reason to go to a given room on my first turn. Just take whatever, right?
- Related: it feels like you could easily get into a rhythm where everyone is in a room at the same time, and then you just have to race to get the reward cards.

### Solutions
- You have missions that don't require every room, but give you a special objective that changes things
  - Missions that require you to make sure a given room is clean at the end.
  - You must do things in a given order. Or you must go somewhere first. Or use a room multipel times.
  - You must bust someone.

### Problem
Each room is functionally the same. 
- Something changes about you or the environment upon using or cleaning a room.

### Solutions
- The proofs you get from rooms can give you special abilities? And maybe there are cool synergistic ways to use them. This also solves the issue of "where do I go first?"
  - What if these were almost like missions too? Like in the kitchen you get oatmeal. Which has a perk that's like "ran right through me." And in order to use it, you have to go to the bathroom twice or something?
  - Some cards have no perk, or maybe even a negative perk. So this is incentive to get in there fast.

### Problem
Being in the Hall is perhaps anticlimactic? But it's critical to the central tension of the game.

### Solutions
- Could there be a special action that you can do in the hallway? Maybe being able to challenge people is good enough.



# Stray ideas
- a card that explicitly requires you to leave a room, and come back to it later. Such as "you can walk around with this pajamas perk, but you cannot end the game with it."
