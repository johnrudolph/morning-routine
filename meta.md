# Elevator pitch
Your alarm rang, and you’re in a mad dash to get out the door. But you’ll have to maneuver around your roommates in this tiny apartment. As you get ready, you’ll leave a trail of mess. If you’re caught in a room with a mess, you’ll be responsible to clean the whole thing. The first player out the door wins. 

# Player experience
- It’s a mad dash. Urgency, chaos, quick decisions
- Bluffing and partial information. There is just enough uncertainty that you can lie, joke, and set traps for your opponents. 
- Quick, funny, low-stakes (an 8 year old could play this game with their grandparents)

# Gameplay
- 3-8 players
- 10-15 minutes
